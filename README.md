# Machine learning to predict early TNF inhibitor users in patients with ankylosing spondylitis

This is the repository for the article submitted to Scientific Reports. The title is 'Machine learning to predict early TNF inhibitor users in patients with ankylosing spondylitis'. We compared various machine learning methods to predict the target population for the early use of TNF inhibitors in AS using baseline characteristics. 


## Environment setting

#### Installing miniconda:

We recommend using miniconda as a package manager when executing these codes. Miniconda can be installed from the following link: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

#### Environment setting:

All software tests were done under the following environment setting, and we highly recommend making the miniconda environment to test codes.

python 3.7.5/
numpy 1.18.0/
keras 2.3.1/
tensorflow 2.0.0
sklearn 0.22


## Input file preparation



## Before start the codes, you have to pre-check following.
1) Your input file has to be tab delimited and including header.
2) Change the path inside each code to appropriate folder or file names.
